She has also contributed to a major research project on Cold War international relations at East China Normal University. Prior to pursuing her Ph.D., Zihuan earned a Master of Arts (MA) in International Relations from Seoul National University and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from Sun Yat-sen University.
