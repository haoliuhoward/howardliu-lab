Welcome! I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Government at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/).

In my research, I write about state repression, human rights, dictatorship, and armed conflict with particular attention to how network relationships shape the use of coercion and violence. My research has been published at <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Journal of Conflict Resolution</i>, <i>Journal of Global Security Studies</i>, and <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>. 

At Essex, I teach graduate-level quantitative methodology.
